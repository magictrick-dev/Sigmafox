# POSY - Parser for COSY

A syntax parser and transpiler for COSY-scripts which produce executable
C++ source files.

# Building POSY

POSY requires CMake to build the project. Given that it is being run on
a Linux environment, the provided `build.sh` and `run.sh` will do the
heavy lifting for you. The `run.sh` script forwards all arguments to POSY,
or simply run POSY from the `./bin` folder.
